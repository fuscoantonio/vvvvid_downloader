The downloader needs the show's ID from VVVVID to download its episodes.

The ID is in the url of the show on vvvvid.it.

Example:

https://www.vvvvid.it/show/404/one-punch-man <--- the ID is 404

https://www.vvvvid.it/show/236/cowboy-bebop <--- the ID is 236


PLEASE NOTE

The downloader relies on ffmpeg.exe to work. The ffmpeg directory in this repository is empty. You can download ffmpeg here: https://ffmpeg.org/download.html. The script only needs ffmpeg.exe, just place it in the ffmpeg folder and you're set.
